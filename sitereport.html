					<h1 class="topic">My Experience On Module</h1>

					<p class="define">Hi, My name is Nabin Kumar Mahato, and I'm here to share the website design,
						 development, coding, and debugging lessons I've learned.	I am a curious learner who enjoys discovering new
						 things. I have a strong interest in studying different non-human languages. 
						 Knowing NAMI College offered BSc. Computing courses and that the instructors were quite approachable,
						  I just recently enrolled. We learned the fundamentals of 
						  HTML and CSS from our module instructor Mr. Ankit Sir, and we are now competent of
						   creating websites. He also showed us how to store the codes for later use by pushing them 
						   to github. Using CSS to design and create a user-friendly website was an easy process thanks 
						   to our tutor's straightforward, risk-free instruction. </p>

					<h1 class="topic">Reflective Discussions</h1> 
					<p class="define">Reflective Discussion essentially encourages
						 students to declare and reflect on what they have heard or learned. 
						 The best learning experience I've ever had in my life has been learning
						  web development, as this module promotes and teaches us to create a 
						  variety of websites and webpages. It motivates us to design 
						  user-friendly, responsive websites that look good on both tiny 
						  and large displays. To provide a great user interface, the website needs 
						  to be responsive across all devices. I also improved my ability to efficiently
						   find and fix errors. Never before has learning been so efficient and simple. 
						   I gained a lot of knowledge in a short amount of time.</p>


					<h1 class="topic"> Site Develpoment Over Terms </h1>
					<p class="define"> I tried multiple times to improve the site's
						 design and appearance, but each time I failed, so I gave up and decided to redesign the entire website.</p>

						 <img src="prevassgn.png" alt="Assignment Image">
                         <p class = "date"> 25 July, 2022 </p>
						 <p class="define">The picture up top represents the first project I created for term 1. 
							I made all of the changes because the UI was severely flawed because the site was not 
							user-friendly. Therefore, I rebuilt the website using the grid display as it was not responsive also and 
							created it as seen in the below image:</p>

						<img src="iniassignment.png" alt="Assignment Image">
                         <p class = "date"> 2 Aug, 2022 </p>
						 <p class="define">The finished product of the webpage is the image up above.
							 The website has a nice User Interface (UI), which is straightforward and responsive.
							  Users can see that the general website layout is the same on every page. 
							  The website's navigation menu is compatible with every page. 
							  The website is responsive, which means that it functions properly on various screen sizes. 
							  Only on mobile phones does the navigation menu hide behind the hamburger icon. 
							  To make the website's background look hip and distinctive, I used a gradient color that is the same on all of the pages.
							   Almost every section, including the theme and subtopics, is written in sans-serif type. 
							   There is a navigation menu underneath the main heading. 
							   The general website layout is the same for each and every page. 
							   Each page is accessible to users via a navigation menu. 
							   Additionally, the website's navigation menu is the same on every page.
							    To avoid being accused of academic dishonesty, I correctly cited and refd the sources when 
								I used certain logos, such as the Facebook, Gmail, and Address logos.</p>
